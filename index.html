        <h1 class="page-title">Rolling Stones - Don't stop</h1>
            <p>Well you bit my lip and drew first blood<br>
                And wore my cold, cold heart<br>
                And your wrote your name right on my back<br>
                Boy your nails were sharp</p>
             <p>Don't stop<br>
                Honey don't stop<br>
                Don't stop<br>
                Baby don't stop</p>
            <p>Well I love your screams of passion<br> 
                In the long hot summer night<br> 
                But you pepper me with poison darts<br> 
                And twisted in your knife</p>
            <p>Don't stop<br> 
                Honey don't stop<br> 
                Don't stop<br> 
                Baby don't stop</p>  
            <p>Well the only thing I ask of you<br> 
                Is to hand me back some pride<br> 
                Don't you dump me on some dusty street<br> 
                And hang me out to dry</p>
            <p>Don't stop<br> 
                Honey don't stop<br> 
                Don't stop<br> 
                Baby don't stop<br>
                Honey</p>
